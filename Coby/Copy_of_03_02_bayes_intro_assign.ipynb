    "\n",
    "$Pr(X=x)$\n",

    "\n",
    "- The data that have been observed are considered **random**, because they are realizations of random processes, and hence will vary each time one goes to observe the system.\n",
    "- Model parameters are considered **fixed**. The parameters' values are unknown, but they are fixed, and so we *condition* on them.\n",

    "In mathematical notation, this implies a (very) general model of the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(y | \\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model $f$ accepts data values $y$ as an argument, conditional on particular values of $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequentist inference typically involves deriving **estimators** for the unknown parameters. Estimators are formulae that return estimates for particular estimands, as a function of data. They are selected based on some chosen optimality criterion, such as *unbiasedness*, *variance minimization*, or *efficiency*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lets say that we have collected some data on the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in some defined population. Our sample includes $n$ sampled children, $y$ of them having been diagnosed with autism. A frequentist estimator of the prevalence $p$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{p} = \\frac{y}{n}$\n",

    "Why this particular function? Because it can be shown to be unbiased and minimum-variance.\n",

    "### The Bayesian World View\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data are considered **fixed**. \n",
    "- Model parameters themselves may not be random, but Bayesians use probability distribtutions to describe their uncertainty in parameter values, and are therefore treated as **random**. In some cases, it is useful to consider parameters as having been sampled from probability distributions.\n",

    "This implies the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(\\theta | y)$\n",

    "Hemophilia is a rare genetic disorder that impairs the ability for the body's clotting factors to coagualate the blood in response to broken blood vessels.

    "This usually cannot be calculated directly. However it is just a normalization constant which doesn't depend on the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The act of summation washes out whatever info we had about the parameter. Hence it can often be ignored. The normalizing constant makes sure that the resulting posterior distribution is a true probability distribution by ensuring that the sum of the distribution is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases we don’t care about this property of the distribution. We only care about where the peak of the distribution occurs, regardless of whether the distribution is normalised or not\n",

    "Unfortunately sometimes we are obliged to calculate it. The intractability of this integral is one of the factors that has contributed to the under-utilization of Bayesian methods by statisticians.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prior\n",
    "\n",
    "Once considered a controversial aspect of Bayesian analysis, the prior distribution characterizes what is known about an unknown quantity before observing the data from the present study. \n",
    "\n",
    "It represents the information state of that parameter. It can be used to reflect the information obtained in previous studies, to constrain the parameter to plausible values, or to represent the population of possible parameter values, of which the current study's parameter value can be considered a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood represents the information in the observed data, and is used to update prior distributions to posterior distributions. This updating of belief is justified becuase of the **likelihood principle**, which states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Following observation of $y$, the likelihood $L(\\theta|y)$ contains all experimental information from $y$ about the unknown $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian analysis satisfies the likelihood principle because the posterior distribution's dependence on the data is only through the likelihood. In comparison, most frequentist inference procedures violate the likelihood principle, because inference will depend on the design of the trial or experiment.\n",

    "\n",
    "There is just one estimator in Bayesian inference, which lends to its ***simplicity***. Moreover, Bayes affords a conceptually simple way of coping with multiple parameters. The use of probabilistic models allows very complex models to be assembled in a modular fashion, by factoring a large joint model into the product of several conditional probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics is also attractive for its ***coherence***. All unknown quantities for a particular problem are treated as random variables, to be estimated in the same way. Existing knowledge is given precise mathematical expression, allowing it to be integrated with information from the study dataset, and there is formal mechanism for incorporating new information into an existing analysis.\n",

    "### Bayesian Inference Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Gelman et al. (2013) describe the process of conducting Bayesian statistical analysis in 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Specify a probability model\n",
    "\n",
    "As was noted above, Bayesian statistics involves using probability models to solve problems. So, the first task is to *completely specify* the model in terms of probability distributions. This includes everything: unknown parameters, data, covariates, missing data, predictions. All must be assigned some probability density.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step involves making choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- what is the form of the sampling distribution of the data?\n",
    "- what form best describes our uncertainty in the unknown parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Calculate a posterior distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The posterior distribution is formulated as a function of the probability model that was specified in Step 1. Usually, we can write it down but we cannot calculate it analytically. In fact, the difficulty inherent in calculating the posterior distribution for most models of interest is perhaps the major contributing factor for the lack of widespread adoption of Bayesian methods for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But**, once the posterior distribution is calculated, you get a lot for free:\n",
    "\n",
    "- point estimates\n",
    "- credible intervals\n",
    "- quantiles\n",
    "- predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Check your model\n",
    "\n",
    "Though frequently ignored in practice, it is critical that the model and its outputs be assessed before using the outputs for inference. Models are specified based on assumptions that are largely unverifiable, so the least we can do is examine the output in detail, relative to the specified model and the data that were used to fit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we must ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "- does the model fit data?\n",
    "- are the conclusions reasonable?\n",
    "- are the outputs sensitive to changes in model structure?\n"
