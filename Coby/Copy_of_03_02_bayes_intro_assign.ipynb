    "#### 1. Classical probability\n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr(X=x) = \\frac{\\text{# x outcomes}}{\\text{# possible outcomes}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Classical probability is an assessment of **possible** outcomes of elementary events. Elementary events are assumed to be equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Frequentist probability\n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr(X=x) = \\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{\\text{# times x has occurred}}{\\text{# independent and identical trials}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This interpretation considers probability to be the relative frequency \"in the long run\" of outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Subjective probability\n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr(X=x)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Subjective probability is a measure of one's uncertainty in the value of \\\\(X\\\\). It characterizes the state of knowledge regarding some unknown quantity using probability.\n",

    "It is not associated with long-term frequencies nor with equal-probability events.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",

    "### The Frequentist World View\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data that have been observed are considered **random**, because they are realizations of random processes, and hence will vary each time one goes to observe the system.\n",
    "- Model parameters are considered **fixed**. The parameters' values are unknown, but they are fixed, and so we *condition* on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical notation, this implies a (very) general model of the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$f(y | \\theta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "The model $f$ accepts data values $y$ as an argument, conditional on particular values of $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequentist inference typically involves deriving **estimators** for the unknown parameters. Estimators are formulae that return estimates for particular estimands, as a function of data. They are selected based on some chosen optimality criterion, such as *unbiasedness*, *variance minimization*, or *efficiency*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lets say that we have collected some data on the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in some defined population. Our sample includes $n$ sampled children, $y$ of them having been diagnosed with autism. A frequentist estimator of the prevalence $p$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\hat{p} = \\frac{y}{n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this particular function? Because it can be shown to be unbiased and minimum-variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that new estimators need to be derived for every estimand that is introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Bayesian World View\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data are considered **fixed**. \n",
    "- Model parameters themselves may not be random, but Bayesians use probability distribtutions to describe their uncertainty in parameter values, and are therefore treated as **random**. In some cases, it is useful to consider parameters as having been sampled from probability distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(\\theta | y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formulation used to be referred to as ***inverse probability***, because it infers from observations to parameters, or from effects to causes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesians do not seek new estimators for every estimation problem they encounter. There is only one estimator for Bayesian inference: **Bayes' Formula**."

    "Hemophilia is a rare genetic disorder that impairs the ability for the body's clotting factors to coagualate the blood in response to broken blood vessels.

    "In this example, consider a woman whose mother is a carrier (because her brother is affected) and who marries an unaffected man. Let's now observe some data: the woman has two consecutive (non-twin) sons who are unaffected. We are interested in determining **if the woman is a carrier**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\\\\[O(W=1) = \\frac{Pr(W=1)}{Pr(W=0)} = 1\\\\]\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"bayes_formula.png\" width=\"200px\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation expresses how our belief about the value of \\\\(\\theta\\\\), as expressed by the **prior distribution** \\\\(P(\\theta)\\\\) is reallocated following the observation of the data \\\\(y\\\\), as expressed by the posterior distribution the posterior distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Marginal\n",
    "\n",
    "The denominator $P(y)$ is the likelihood integrated over all $\\theta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr(\\theta|y) = \\frac{Pr(y|\\theta)Pr(\\theta)}{\\int Pr(y|\\theta)Pr(\\theta) d\\theta}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This usually cannot be calculated directly. However it is just a normalization constant which doesn't depend on the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "The act of summation washes out whatever info we had about the parameter. Hence it can often be ignored. The normalizing constant makes sure that the resulting posterior distribution is a true probability distribution by ensuring that the sum of the distribution is equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases we don’t care about this property of the distribution. We only care about where the peak of the distribution occurs, regardless of whether the distribution is normalised or not\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately sometimes we are obliged to calculate it. The intractability of this integral is one of the factors that has contributed to the under-utilization of Bayesian methods by statisticians.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prior\n",
    "\n",
    "Once considered a controversial aspect of Bayesian analysis, the prior distribution characterizes what is known about an unknown quantity before observing the data from the present study. \n",
    "\n",
    "It represents the information state of that parameter. It can be used to reflect the information obtained in previous studies, to constrain the parameter to plausible values, or to represent the population of possible parameter values, of which the current study's parameter value can be considered a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood represents the information in the observed data, and is used to update prior distributions to posterior distributions. This updating of belief is justified becuase of the **likelihood principle**, which states:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Following observation of $y$, the likelihood $L(\\theta|y)$ contains all experimental information from $y$ about the unknown $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian analysis satisfies the likelihood principle because the posterior distribution's dependence on the data is only through the likelihood. In comparison, most frequentist inference procedures violate the likelihood principle, because inference will depend on the design of the trial or experiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a likelihood function? It is closely related to the probability density (or mass) function. Taking a common example, consider some data that are binomially distributed (that is, they describe the outcomes of $n$ binary events). Here is the binomial sampling distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$p(Y|\\theta) = {n \\choose y} \\theta^{y} (1-\\theta)^{n-y}$\n",

    "#### Bayesian Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bayesian approach is attractive because it is useful. Its usefulness derives in large measure from its simplicity. Its simplicity allows the investigation of far more complex models than can be handled by the tools in the classical toolbox.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There is just one estimator in Bayesian inference, which lends to its ***simplicity***. Moreover, Bayes affords a conceptually simple way of coping with multiple parameters. The use of probabilistic models allows very complex models to be assembled in a modular fashion, by factoring a large joint model into the product of several conditional probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian statistics is also attractive for its ***coherence***. All unknown quantities for a particular problem are treated as random variables, to be estimated in the same way. Existing knowledge is given precise mathematical expression, allowing it to be integrated with information from the study dataset, and there is formal mechanism for incorporating new information into an existing analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Bayesian statistics confers an advantage in the ***interpretability*** of analytic outputs. Because models are expressed probabilistically, results can be interpreted probabilistically. Probabilities are easy for users (particularly non-technical users) to understand and apply."

    "### Example: confidence vs. credible intervals\n",
    "\n",
    "A commonly-used measure of uncertainty for a statistical point estimate in classical statistics is the ***confidence interval***. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the mathematical definition of a 95% confidence interval for some unknown scalar quantity $\\theta$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr(a(Y) < \\theta < b(Y) | \\theta) = 0.95$\n",
    "\n",
    "How the endpoints of this interval are calculated varies according to the sampling distribution of $Y$, for example, the confidence interval for the population mean when $Y$ is normally distributed is calculated by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$Pr(\\bar{Y} - 1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}< \\theta < \\bar{Y} + 1.96\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}) = 0.95$\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be tempting to use this definition to conclude that there is a 95% chance $\\theta$ is between $a(Y)$ and $b(Y)$, but that would be a mistake. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that for frequentists, unknown parameters are **fixed**, which means there is no probability associated with them being any value except what they are fixed to. Here, the interval itself, and not \\\\(\\theta\\\\) is the random variable. The actual interval calculated from the data is just one possible realization of a random process, and it must be strictly interpreted only in relation to an infinite sequence of identical trials that might be (but never are) conducted in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid interpretation of the above would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "> If the experiment were repeated an infinite number of times, 95% of the calculated intervals would contain $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Bayesian Inference Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Gelman et al. (2013) describe the process of conducting Bayesian statistical analysis in 3 steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Specify a probability model\n",
    "\n",
    "As was noted above, Bayesian statistics involves using probability models to solve problems. So, the first task is to *completely specify* the model in terms of probability distributions. This includes everything: unknown parameters, data, covariates, missing data, predictions. All must be assigned some probability density.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step involves making choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- what is the form of the sampling distribution of the data?\n",
    "- what form best describes our uncertainty in the unknown parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Calculate a posterior distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The posterior distribution is formulated as a function of the probability model that was specified in Step 1. Usually, we can write it down but we cannot calculate it analytically. In fact, the difficulty inherent in calculating the posterior distribution for most models of interest is perhaps the major contributing factor for the lack of widespread adoption of Bayesian methods for data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But**, once the posterior distribution is calculated, you get a lot for free:\n",
    "\n",
    "- point estimates\n",
    "- credible intervals\n",
    "- quantiles\n",
    "- predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Check your model\n",
    "\n",
    "Though frequently ignored in practice, it is critical that the model and its outputs be assessed before using the outputs for inference. Models are specified based on assumptions that are largely unverifiable, so the least we can do is examine the output in detail, relative to the specified model and the data that were used to fit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we must ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "- does the model fit data?\n",
    "- are the conclusions reasonable?\n",
    "- are the outputs sensitive to changes in model structure?\n"
