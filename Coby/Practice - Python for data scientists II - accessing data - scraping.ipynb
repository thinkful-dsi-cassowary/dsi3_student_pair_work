However, there are times when the data you want can only be accessed as part of a web page. In this case you will want to use a technique called *web scraping* to get the data from the web page and format it for further analysis.\n","\n","In this notebook, we will go over how to work with the `Requests` and `BeautifulSoup` Python libraries in order to make use of data from web pages.
